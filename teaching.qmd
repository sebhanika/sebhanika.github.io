I began teaching at the university level in March 2023. My goal is to create more interactive materials and exercises for teaching quantitative methods. Additionally, I plan to deliver guest lectures in population and economic geography, aligning with my research interests. Some of my teaching materials are available on Github for [population geography](https://github.com/sebhanika/pop-geo-teaching) and [quantitaive methods](https://github.com/sebhanika/stats_teaching).
